#FingerTracker: Gesture-Based Drawing Using MediaPipe and OpenCV
This Python program uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to implement a gesture-controlled drawing application that allows users to draw on a 
virtual canvas using their left index finger, while toggling drawing mode using a right-hand fist gesture.


Key Features:
üñêÔ∏è Dual Hand Tracking: Utilizes MediaPipe to detect and track both hands in real time.

‚úçÔ∏è Drawing with Index Finger: When drawing mode is enabled, the left index fingertip draws on a transparent canvas overlaid on the camera feed.

‚úä Fist Gesture Toggle: A right-hand fist (held for at least 1 second) toggles the drawing mode (on/off).

üß† Finger Counting: Robust finger detection logic estimates how many fingers are up using joint landmark comparisons, including a special thumb check.

üßº Canvas Clearing: Press 'c' to clear the canvas.

‚ùå Exit: Press 'q' to quit the application.


How It Works:
Hand Detection:

MediaPipe identifies and classifies each hand as Left or Right from the camera's perspective.

This is interpreted in a mirror view: MediaPipe‚Äôs "Left" is the user‚Äôs right hand, and "Right" is the left hand.

Drawing Logic:

If drawing mode is active and the left index fingertip is detected, the program draws lines between successive index finger positions.

The drawn strokes appear semi-transparent over the video feed.

Fist-Based Control:

If a fist is detected on the user's right hand for more than 1 second, the drawing mode toggles on or off.

This enables hands-free mode switching without pressing buttons.

Dependencies:
opencv-python

mediapipe

numpy

A working webcam

Usage:
Run the script and:

Use your left hand's index finger to draw.

Show a fist with your right hand for one second to toggle drawing mode.

Press 'c' to clear the canvas, 'q' to quit.
