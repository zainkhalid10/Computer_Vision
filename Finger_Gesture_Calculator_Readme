#Finger Gesture Calculator
This project implements a finger-based gesture calculator using MediaPipe and OpenCV. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using only their hand gestures in front of a webcam.

🎯 How It Works
Finger Counting: Detects how many fingers are held up and interprets this as a number (0–10).

Gesture Recognition: Detects specific hand gestures representing operations:

➕ Plus: Crossed index and middle fingers

➖ Minus: Index finger up only

✖️ Multiply: Spread "V" sign (index and middle)

➗ Divide: Only pinky finger up

State Machine:

WAIT_FIRST – User shows the first number

WAIT_OP – User shows the arithmetic operation

WAIT_SECOND – User shows the second number

SHOW_RESULT – The system computes and displays the result

Reset Mechanism: Show a closed fist for 1 second to reset and start a new calculation.

🧠 Features
Real-time hand landmark tracking

Finger-counting with stability check (hold steady for 3 seconds)

Gesture-based operation detection with accuracy threshold

Result display and automatic reset mechanism

Intuitive on-screen instructions and status feedback

📦 Dependencies
Python 3.7+
OpenCV
MediaPipe
NumPy

Install via:
          pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
Run the calculator:
          python finger_calculator.py

Hold up fingers to show:
A number (0–10) → First operand
An operation gesture (as defined above)
Another number → Second operand


✅ The result is shown on-screen.
✊ Show a fist for 1 second to reset.
