#VanishingShirt: Real-Time Shirt Vanishing Effect Using MediaPipe and OpenCV
This Python application uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to create a vanishing effect, where parts of a person (typically the shirt or body) 
become invisible and are replaced by a previously captured background. This illusion is toggled by a palm gesture or activated automatically after a short delay.


🧠 Core Concept:
The effect is achieved using background subtraction — comparing the live webcam frame to a stored background image (when the user is absent).

Areas that differ significantly from the background (i.e., the user’s body or shirt) are replaced with the original background, making them appear invisible.

Key Features:
🖐️ Hand Detection: Uses MediaPipe to track hands and detect palm gestures (all fingers down).

🎬 Auto Background Capture:

Begins with a 3-second countdown to let the user step out of the frame.

Captures the static background for comparison.

🧞‍♂️ Vanish Mode:

Auto-starts after 5 seconds of background capture.

Can be toggled manually by holding a palm gesture for 0.7 seconds.

✨ Invisibility Effect:

Detected foreground (e.g. user’s body) is replaced with the original background.

Uses grayscale difference and thresholding for masking.

🔁 Re-capture Background: Press 'b' to recapture the background anytime.

❌ Exit: Press 'q' to quit the program.

How It Works:
Background Capture:

At launch (or when 'b' is pressed), a 3-second countdown lets the user leave the frame.

The system captures a clean background image.

Hand Gesture Detection:

Using landmark positions, the system checks if all fingers are down (palm gesture).

Holding the palm gesture toggles vanish mode on/off.

Invisibility Logic:

Computes the difference between the live frame and the background.

Uses a mask to isolate moving objects (typically the user).

These parts are replaced with the background image.

Dependencies:
opencv-python

mediapipe

numpy

A webcam

Instructions:
Run the script and step out of the frame during the countdown.

Return and observe the vanish effect on your shirt/body.

Toggle the effect with a palm gesture.

Press 'b' to reset the background, 'q' to quit.
