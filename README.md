#Computer Vision Projects with MediaPipe & OpenCV
This repository showcases a collection of real-time computer vision applications built using MediaPipe and OpenCV. Each project explores interactive and intuitive gesture-based interfaces, demonstrating how machine learning models can be used to interpret human movement and perform dynamic tasks with just a webcam.

Whether it's detecting body parts, drawing in the air, performing calculations using hand gestures, or creating visual illusions like invisibility, these projects combine creativity and technical skill to bring engaging human-computer interaction experiences to life.





# Body-parts-detector
Real-time Body Part Detector Using MediaPipe A real-time application that detects when a user points to a specific body part using their index finger. Built with OpenCV and MediaPipe Pose and Hands modules, it identifies body landmarks and highlights the part being touched or pointed at.

#Finger Gesture Calculator
This project implements a finger-based gesture calculator using MediaPipe and OpenCV. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using only their hand gestures in front of a webcam.

#FingerTracker: Gesture-Based Drawing Using MediaPipe and OpenCV
This Python program uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to implement a gesture-controlled drawing application that allows users to draw on a virtual canvas using their left index finger, while toggling drawing mode using a right-hand fist gesture.


#VanishingShirt: Real-Time Shirt Vanishing Effect Using MediaPipe and OpenCV
This Python application uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to create a vanishing effect, where parts of a person (typically the shirt or body) become invisible and are replaced by a previously captured background. This illusion is toggled by a palm gesture or activated automatically after a short delay.
